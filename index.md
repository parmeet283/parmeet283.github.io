# Favorite labs in CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    This was one of my favorite labs because this was my first time using github and writing in the terminal. During this lab I had 2 partners and was able to meet new people for the first time. The first lab also showed me how challenging this class would be and made me prepare more.The experience with the terminal, github, and working with partners, gave me more confidence.

* Lab 7
    I also enjoyed doing lab 7 because we were using real life situations in our code. We were using a parking sign and when or when not to be able to park there. We had to debug the compiling errors and use For, If statements. I just liked this lab because it showed me what was the blueprint behind machines at parking structures.

* Lab 8
    I liked doing this lab because we were finding the maximum, minimum, and average in the olympic scores.In this lab we used vectors of doubles and If, For statements. In my head it just showed me how a calculator is able to get those three values. I liked this lab because we started using math symbols such as the greater or less than sign for the scores.
